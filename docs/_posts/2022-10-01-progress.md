### Rails deployments

- now that heroku is changing it's plans
- [ ] using AWS? and terrraform?
  - [https://medium.com/@ajays871/rails-6-deployment-using-terraform-docker-and-aws-codepipeline-a5fb15ede5eb](https://medium.com/@ajays871/rails-6-deployment-using-terraform-docker-and-aws-codepipeline-a5fb15ede5eb)

- [ ] using Amazon S3 select [https://towardsdatascience.com/ditch-the-database-20a5a0a1fb72](https://towardsdatascience.com/ditch-the-database-20a5a0a1fb72)

## Hack

* read convincing reviews like [JetPens Boxy review](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Boxy-Eraser-Black/reviews/499?sa=date_added&so=-1) and convert the "noun" to your own product for comic relief.
* there is an API for getting quotes [https://quotes.rest/](https://quotes.rest/) and docs [https://theysaidso.com/api/](https://theysaidso.com/api/)
  - dad jokes - https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search

## GitHub Profiles

* there seem a lot of things you can setup on github
  - tags
  - releases
  - contributors
  - users of your product
  - landing pages for users using a repo of the same name as the user [https://github.com/saramic/saramic](https://github.com/saramic/saramic)
    - some interesting things can be done eg [https://github.com/sjalex78/sjalex78](https://github.com/sjalex78/sjalex78) using the github stats code
    - which uses [https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) running on vercel
      {% highlight markdown %}
      [![Sarah's GitHub stats](
        https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=sjalex78&show_icons=true&theme=cobalt)](
        https://github.com/sjalex78/github-readme-stats)
      {% endhighlight %}
  - What about landing pages for an organisation? is it something like [https://github.com/nrwl/.github/tree/main/profile](https://github.com/nrwl/.github/tree/main/profile) ?
    - [ ] should set something up for [https://github.com/failure-driven](https://github.com/failure-driven)
