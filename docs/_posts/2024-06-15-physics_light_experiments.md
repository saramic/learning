Forever I wanted to build a heliostat - a device with a mirror that follows the
sun ☀️  and guides the light into 1 spot.

I even started a project 9 years ago
[https://github.com/saramic/eternal-sunspots](https://github.com/saramic/eternal-sunspots)
to build one and have it controlled by simple javascript program that can be
written by kids.

There is also one in Sydney I visited, but here is probably a more informative
news report on it

  - **One Central Park's famous heliostat - The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age**

    [![

Recenty one of my sons built a make shift pin hole camera where he was
intruigued at the dimmer, and yet focused view of his LED light. He was asking
for some tracing paper to act as a sort of display. This got me thinking about
a bunch of other related experiments like diffraction gratings, making
spectroscopes fromm DVDs (acting as the diffraction grating) and visual acuity,
experiments around when a display is a "retina display".

so taking to the web I found a bunch of resources and tools we could get to
explore further.

## Spectroscope

A bunch of simple videos out there for kids to build one using an old DVD/CD

  - and the article behind it
    [https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/cd-spectroscope](
    https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/cd-spectroscope)
    presumably it may have the template for the cutting out of the tube etc
  - another similar design [https://buggyandbuddy.com/homemade-spectroscope/](
    https://buggyandbuddy.com/homemade-spectroscope/)

- a different design removing the protective coating and just attaching it to a
  toilet roll tube as a see through option

What most of these seem to miss is lining the inside with black paper
(_assuming that is an option, which it is in my case_) or even painting it
witll matt black paint, like say chalk board paint. Finally I was hoping that
one of these would put a ruler in there or some guide so you could hope to
"compare" what is viewed. It does feel most of these are driven at "just create
a rainbow" for your kids as opposed to be able to see spectral lines in a
sodium or mercury street lamp, or when buring a salt in a flame? I suppose it
may be time to build and experiment.

Which reminds me the first time I saw this idea was in one of the O'Reilly
books on forensics, [Illustrated Guide to Home Forensic Science Experiments
by Robert Bruce Thompson, Barbara Fritchman Thompson](

**OR** maybe that is the point, to end up with an "optical experimenters" setup

at some stage the idea would be to also be able to move a mirror or light in a controlled manner. It sounds like precision "piezo motor stages" like [pi-usa.us](https://www.pi-usa.us/en/products/piezo-motors-stages-actuators) are the way to go.

> The angular resolution of the human eye typically ranges between 40
> arcseconds and 1 arcminute. To perceive two separate points, at least three
> photoreceptors arranged in a row are required: one to receive light from each

> resolution of 1 arcminute (which corresponds to 0.3 m at a distance of 1 km),
> the images on the retina are separated by approximately 6 μm, meaning the
> centre-to-centre distance between two neighbouring receptors is 3 μm. At an
> angular resolution of 40 arcseconds, the distance between the imaged points
> is approximately 4 μm.
