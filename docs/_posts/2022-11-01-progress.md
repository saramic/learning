## Progress November 2022 

### Heroku Replacement

Seems that Heroku is shutting down free instances on [28th November 2022](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter) so I might need to pull some data prior to that. I will also need to find a replacement for quickly deploying a rails project.

  - plus the plethora of options for DIY deploy on whatever VPS you like
    best...

- now for pulling data from Heroku?
  - there was a `heroku db:pull` and a `heroku pg:pull and pg:push` ?
  - assuming you are running the right version of production DB
{% highlight bash %}
    heroku pg:backups:capture --app example-app
    heroku pg:backups:download --app example-app

    pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U $USER \
      -d example-app_development latest.dump
{% endhighlight %}
