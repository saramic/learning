great talk Seven Years Later: What the Agile Manifesto Left Out | Brian Marick
| Better Software East
1. courage
1. working software
1. ease
1. fast feedback
1. naivet√©
1. visibility
1. joy

**courage** to break company rules and re-arrange cubicles for a better team
environment setup - or charge ahead implementing an AI/event-ed solution when
that is not currently on the roadmap

**working software** this one is huge for me - a quote from Kent Beck - no
discussion should go on for more than 15 minutes without bringing up a computer
and doing some experimenting - for me this is also true about sharing any
issues or ideas or even PR reviews - I always try and add some cut & paste code
example to make it real and immediately actionable

**ease** this is huge and often a frustration as teams expand and forget to
take care of their tools to make future changes and just working in the code a
**joy**

## On clean code being slow

functions etc.
