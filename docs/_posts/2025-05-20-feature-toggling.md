A while ago I went to a React Melbourne meetup and saw a presentation about
feature toggling

**React Melbourne Meetup - 21st July 2022 - React Melbourne**

It was a good overview of the kinds of feature toggles, their uses and pitfalls
especially around having too many as well as automated testing.

The presentation can be found here:
