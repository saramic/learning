## Cleaning up some Lambdas at work ...

... came across this serverless rust tutorial on youtube

[![

)

and given it covered off a bunch of things I have an interest in

- rust
- SAM (Serverless Application Model) AWS cloudformation framework
- tutorials on lambdas
- testing lambdas
- processing kinesis streams
- posting OpenTelemetry stats
- configuration management, project setup and other related things

I thought that it would be worth my while watching and as it was quite good, to
the point, not too long and well split out into meaningful chunks I thought I
should also follow along.

As always with these things, things change and go out of date. What was the
default `sam init` choose rust and `Hello World` that does a PUT API to Dynamo
DB has moved away from that and actually just does a Hello World.

Also on skipping around in the tutorial, being that I was watching it a second
time and it was different to the code I had generated, I missed the bit where
you had to do a `sam build` before you do a `sam deploy`. This lead me down a
long path of errors around `Unzipped size too big`

```sh
CREATE_FAILED            AWS::Lambda::Function    HelloWorldFunction

Resource handler returned message: "Unzipped size must be smaller than
262144000 bytes (Service: Lambda, Status Code: 400, Request ID: ...)"
(RequestToken: 827ca4b9-47bf-ee04- bf8a-62dd8362c7a9, HandlerErrorCode:
InvalidRequest)

ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS     AWS::CloudFormation::Stack rust-sample
```

Once that happend once, I could not get around as I continually got a
`ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS`. I started to hunt around all the things that **sam**
had created like 128MB artefacts on S3. Finally I found the **CloudFormation**
stacks and that I had to just delete the one that had failed to deploy. There
is some setting to do that automatcially but once it's there I think you need
to go and delete it. Anway after that long detour I could continue and get a
Hello World Rust powered lambda out there.

```sh
vi README.md    # to work out to do a sam deploy

sam build
sam deploy

# using the presented endpoints I could now hit them to see the response of
# Hello World
curl https://iepd21535e.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/
curl https://iepd21535e.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/ -v
```

thinking it would be too hard to re-type the dynamo DB rust example from the
YouTube, I decided to do another `sam init` and see what else I could create. I
found that there was a **Dynamo DB example** and lo and behold, it was _only_
avaialble in rust. I created a new project and took a look. Seemed close
enought so I ported across the differences in rust code and settings to create
DynamoDB and sure enough it worked.

```sh
sam init    # create a dynamo-example

# checked some difefrences
vimdiff ../rust-sample/README.md README.md
vimdiff ../rust-sample/samconfig.toml samconfig.toml
vimdiff ../rust-sample/template.yaml template.yaml
vimdiff ../../rust-sample/rust_app/Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
vimdiff ../../rust-sample/rust_app/src/main.rs src/main.rs

# changing back into my modified rust-sample app
sam build # this took forever with no feedback so I stopped
# and ran
cd rust_app
cargo build     # now with feedback of what is comiling
cargo lambda build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# and this worked
sam build

# a deploy
sam deploy

# and I could try
curl \
    https://iepd21535e.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/ \
    -X PUT \
    -d '{"hello":"world"}'

# responded with
{"message":"Missing Authentication Token"}

# which threw me for a while until I re-watched that part of the video and
# worked out it needs an ID
curl \
    https://iepd21535e.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/12345 \
    -X PUT \
    -d '{"hello":"world"}'

# now responded with ðŸŽ‰
item saved

# reading some more I found out I could:
# run some tests
cargo test

# view some logs
sam logs --name PutFunction --stack-name rust-sample --tail

# with some auto config
sam logs --stack-name rust-sample --tail
```

and after all is done

```sh
sam delete
```
