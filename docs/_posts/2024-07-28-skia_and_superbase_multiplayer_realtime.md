    - setting the scene of AI and how it fits into the broader population
    - using https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat - a really good demo to
      help understand statistical next token
    - how to fine tune things like "full spectrum" and "temperature" settings
      the importance of context
    - a great demo of using voice to input data - I am starting to use this a lot more these days (taking notes whilst on a walk)
    - touches on "the new interface" for AI that is yet to be developed
    - they microwave their tea water because 110V in US
    - the importance of the system prompt (context)
    - copilot features
    - calls out references
    - not in talk but you can also set file with #file and or @workspace to set the context
    - how to get around the boundaries of copilot to do more than programming tasks or it's guard rails
    - GPT-3 families - sizes
    - using https://lmstudio.ai/ to work with a local model running on something like ollama
    - the idea of running your own model
    - using AI for chat bots is lazy usage
    - instead some ideas demonstrating smart components https://github.com/dotnet-smartcomponents/smartcomponents
    - build natural language intervaces using types https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat
    - running ollama locally - and why use a smaller model
