### 2023 Jun - Present Senior Engineer Mable

  - **“Tooling & Developer Experience”**
    - **Sweeping Improvements in the Support Squad**
        - Established continuity processes between support squads like weekly
          logs, structured playbooks and alerting, handover meetings for both
          support squad and over arching team leaderships which in turn lead to
          proactive fixes that reduced future problems.
    - **Improving Reproducibility & Tooling for Development**
        - Fixed drift in database migrations between production, release and
          developer environment as well as added tooling in CI (Continuous
          Integration) and developer-friendly tooling to prevent future
          discrepancies and avoid timely outages.
        - Drove adoption of better tooling for repository setup and maintenance
          like Makefiles, Justfiles, ASDF adoption, Brewfile configuration, and
          API documentation—many of which have now become organic best
          practices across teams.
  - **“Mentorship & Engineering Culture”**
    - **Teaching & Mentorship Through the Coding Dojo**
        - Ran a weekly coding dojo for over 1.5 years, focusing on pairing and
          test- driven development (TDD). Created a space where developers of
          all levels felt empowered to take the lead and drive sessions.
          Fostered a culture of cross- team learning, allowing engineers from
          various teams to participate, teach, and elevate Mable’s overall
          engineering capability.
    - **Cross-Team Collaboration & Engineering Culture Building**
        - Ran meetings across various parts of engineering both Backend and
          Frontend to improve engineering output, sharing of information and
          address technical and security issues. Re-architected the ADR
          (Architecture Decision Record) process to be more of a reference for
          why decissions were made. Drove a large change in linting across the
          codebases to reduce unnecessary code churn in reviews which spend up
          the review process overall.
    - **Innovation**
        - Created a cross-team “bat signal” IoT hackathon project using MQTT
          and ESP32; sustained community via bi-monthly hobby meetups.
        - introduced team to outside in BDD and flow style testing.
        - introduced the Front/End team to unit testing using vitest.
        - prototyped a bunch of other approaches like: AWS CDK deployments,
          RUST lambdas, Terraform for local development, bitmap DB indexed data
          and a share repository for all developers to share their spikes and
          findings.
  - **“Cross-Service Architecture”**
    - Architected a scalable cross-service comms layer, evolving from
      point-to-point to Kinesis-based streaming; used transactional
      inbox/outbox and robust Datadog monitoring.
