    search random-data-api for things like `name` or `food` if you type
    something invalid it will give you an error but the subscription to events
    is open. If you do this quickly, a request will be performed for each click
    as we are using `concatMap` which does things one by one.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>switchMap()</code> - will immediately drop previous subscription and
    start a new one. In HTTP this would lead to a request being dropped and
    another one being created which could lead to responses out of order and
    more than one request to the server. It can be useful for giving the latest
    when transforming the response data. - quick reaction to new source values,
    order mostly safe, cancels/unsubscribes, memory leaks not dangerous.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>mergeMap()</code> - instant, concurrent and could be out of order -
    could cause memory leak if cleanup is missed. Order is not preserved so this
    needs to be kept in mind if using with HTTP. - concurent, memory leaks hard
    to notice, no definite order.
