quick start as part of udemy course

udemy course:
    https://www.udemy.com/course/rxjs-and-observables
recomends stackblitz setup or this code setup
    https://github.com/JerryDoubleU/rxjs-playground
but here the vite setup seems much simpler
```
    npm init --yes
    # change to "type": "module",
    npm add rxjs
    npm add --save-dev vite typescript
    # add some script options to run vite
```
run demo and watch the console
