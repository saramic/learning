Each component can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, which gives us a number of benefits:\r\n\r\nAgility: We can iterate on our applications more quickly, as we don't have to wait for the entire application to be updated.\r\nScalability: We can scale our applications more easily, as we can scale each component independently.\r\nMaintainability: We can maintain our applications more easily, as each component is self-contained and can be updated or replaced without affecting the rest of the application.\r\nAs the adoption of microfrontends grows, we can expect to see new tools and standards emerge that will make them even easier to use. But even today, microfrontends is a powerful architecture that can help us build better frontend applications.\r\n\r\nI will start the talk with how an unexpected encounter with a rhino during my cycling trip to Nepal led me to embrace the concept of micro frontends.

We'll gradually add more complex requirements, such as the need to ensure courses don't become over-enrolled - which will prompt us to do some code-smell refactoring, strangely enough arriving at things that start to look like the DDD tactical patterns of repositories, aggregates and domain services.\r\n\r\nIn implementing these requirements, inspiration will strike! What if the model were changed - what if we allowed all enrolments and then allocated resources to the most popular courses as required so we never have to prevent a student from enrolling? We'll now see how the TDD tests and the neatly refactored domain models make it much easier to embark on this dramatic change - in other words, how much more maintainable our DDD codebase has become.","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"4eLLD7PIbKx4i1L3tKTSQ1gUlRVVaFhlP43lZsBdDKnovtxce16xd8weJqM1gR2tdvcZY1DqGAhvW38bGi778wU9y8MuedNyD7r7cEw5tpm1AI7snG9KgdJj5Yp+tRtCMXuWhX5PqyUbg2qnIlSmspMbVHhn58MI9+iSJTl8KWjHXu95TnPGPAJZLdCGlwug","Title":"Pentesting Automation using Golang","Abstract":"Golang is a programming language launched by Google and is best suited in cybersecurity because of its ease of typing, concurrency and multipurposefulness. \r\nWhat we will cover at this session:\r\n- Secure Coding practices promoted by Go\r\n- Why Go is suitable for custom exploit development\r\n- Live Demo: Building a Go-based Pentesting Automation Framework to implement the following: 1) Port Scanning, 2) Brute-Force Attacks and 3) Privilege Escalation\r\n- Q&A and discussion on the session","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

But the same is not true for mobile apps. Did you want to kick start your journey into mobile test automation ? Or have you found it harder to choose the right one for your team ? Let's get started!\r\n\r\nMobile apps have grown exponentially over the last few years. Usability, convenience and user experience has made mobile apps very popular. While web apps are still popular, the testing methods and test frameworks have become so mature due to the longevity of the technology. The same cannot be said for mobile apps. \r\n\r\nWhile development of mobile apps have become easier and more adaptable over the years, testing and test frameworks have not grown at the same pace. Therefore it has been considerably easier to test and write test frameworks for web apps than for mobile. \r\n\r\nSo how do we solve this problem ? The best way to deal with this, is to try out the different options available in the market. In this talk, I will be showing with real examples, how to write an end to end test for a mobile app using Espresso, XCUI Testing, Detox and Appium. At the same time, I will also explain where these frameworks can add value to the teams, that way you can pick the best one that suits your team and your team’s skill sets. \r\n\r\nLet's get more confident in writing tests for mobile apps!","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"9IUJdw3BwgG/dMcUE0U5nfk6rrBnSMnnuOufUUbMkxXgRqywNSDQgM3yLP/sleKwGfxAcZ9H7PAZ2pE4//eYozVxAtQ9qjuITEDatTf6VkJme4iqA92N4wyYRpl+oDPmw/lwdivER4CCPe8MxyY7WijjxC5nflnpVbrcivltOPwk5bCRRksVmRjGhlMYMgod","Title":"Deep Learning","Abstract":"Unveiling the power of Neural Networks","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

You’ve been taught the technical basics in school, but how do you navigate the early days at a new workplace? After all, working in the industry isn’t as straightforward as in the classroom; it’s no longer about attending classes and writing exams. This territory feels unfamiliar to most of us because we’re not taught how best to approach the early days at a new job. This presentation addresses those early days as a recent graduate, where one can feel very lost and uncertain, with tips to start making meaningful contributions, creating a great first impression, and setting yourself up for long-term success!\r\n\r\nDetailed description:\r\nThis will be a story-telling style presentation specifically meant for interns, new graduates, and junior engineers just starting their careers within the tech industry. For each of the 6 sections listed below, I plan to share 1-2 personal experiences and conclude each category by sharing my recommendations on best approaching the challenges stated. Sharing personal experiences makes the content more relatable for attendees and also keeps them engaged for a more extended period. I have done a similar style of presentation at other speaking engagements.\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n- Overview of the motivation behind this talk. This session addresses those early days as a new employee within the tech industry, where one can feel very lost and uncertain, with tips to start making meaningful contributions, creating a great first impression, and setting yourself up for long-term success!\r\n- About me: a quick overview of my educational and professional background.\r\n- Agenda of the session.\r\n\r\nThe session will focus on the following areas:\r\n1. Reflect on existing processes/documentation \r\nEvery team has its processes/style of documentation, which offers you an excellent opportunity to make a meaningful contribution! For example, suppose your onboarding was challenging because of the lack of documentation/processes. In that case, this could be something that you could work on, especially since you have a fresh perspective as a new hire. Alternatively, you could also look into ways of improving existing processes/documentation.\r\n\r\n2. The Art of Asking Questions \r\nAs overwhelming as it can be to ask a question, especially when starting a job as a new graduate, there is an art to asking questions that can allow you to feel both empowered and unintimidated. This includes doing your research before, using the rubber duck technique before asking the question, and respecting people’s time. \r\n\r\n3. Deep Dive into your Projects \r\nEven on teams with excellent documentation, getting started on your technical projects can be very daunting since multiple components are involved. Over time though, you will understand how these things are done on your team. However, it can save you much time and potential headaches to figure this out early on by keeping a handy list to refer to, including basic project setup, testing requirements, review and deployment processes, task tracking, and documentation.\r\n\r\n4. Gaining Technical Context \r\nGaining a high-level overview of your project at the very beginning is invaluable because it allows you to gain a deeper understanding of the work you’ll be doing and feel more connected to your team and company in general. \r\n\r\n5. Establish Expectations \r\nTo set yourself up for long-term success, it’s imperative that you establish a transparent benchmark/criteria from the get-go. If there isn’t a clear one available, work with your manager to develop one. This allows you to be strategic with your career growth and removes any vagueness surrounding what is expected of you and how your performance will be evaluated moving forward. Additionally, it offers you greater clarity in terms of what you’re doing well and what could be improved upon.\r\n\r\n6. Working in Distributed Teams and Maintaining a Work-Life Balance \r\nWhen starting your career, it’s very easy to get caught up in your work, often leading to new employees working overtime. Initially, one might not be cognizant of this, but over time, this can lead to extreme burnout and myriad other issues. It’s crucial to maintain a work-life balance, even more so now when a vast majority of people work from home and across various timezones, and the separation between work and a life outside work gets blurred. This includes turning off notifications, being diligent about not working on weekends, and using your paid time off.\r\n\r\n- Conclusion\r\n\r\n- Q&A\r\n\r\nPrerequisite knowledge: Just a healthy curiosity for how to set yourself up for success in your new tech role!\r\n\r\nLearning outcomes:\r\n1. Outline strategies to set yourself up for short- and long-term success in your new tech role.\r\n2. Structure your approach to best assimilate within your new work environment.\r\n3. Exemplify the importance of communication, asking questions, and maintaining a work-life balance among others in your professional endeavors.\r\n","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"jWIrNIXnzWTukQnynOZGze5Z59iTvxQlxbZNB43eWHB2Jal+d8Ku75DOW7L2sm6CWIDN3NRLCYPY+C0YBybyIV1XVUn+Uv+WLGoGvl9tppIP8lwrOXTpHUid5uTCJvA6oWnYqwlV02rDPG3kJpwjnOYJRMqytRQ06yxwsTwqZ7gYgLdnKzGdDdwBWRMhu+Gy","Title":"HTTP API Design: A beginner's guide","Abstract":"As a developer, chances are you have created, consumed (or both) APIs at some point in your career.

Machine learning is increasingly becoming a vital tool in all domains including frontend application development. However, a front-end developer might feel intimidated by the thought of having to learn complex machine-learning algorithms and new languages. \r\nBut don’t worry, this talk aims to cover how the availability of state of art machine learning libraries for frontend developers makes it easy for frontend developers to integrate machine learning capabilities without any prior experience with Machine learning. This talk will explore some of the state-of-the-art Machine learning libraries and tools available for frontend developers like TensorFlowJS, Onnxjs, WebAI, and WebNN that allow for machine learning inference directly on the client side: i.e. on the browser and able to run neural networks directly in the browser. The talk will also cover how these libraries use existing and upcoming browser technologies like WebGPU, WASM, and WebGL to achieve better performance for in-browser inference. Today most of the most popular machine learning systems and libraries like Huggingface are also being ported to the browser and JavaScript, thus making it accessible for frontend developers to integrate these libraries to build extremely innovative applications. \r\nNot only this, but the talk will also cover how frontend developers can use APIs from OpenAI, Replicate, and serverless functions in order to get additional machine learning capabilities for their applications. In order to further validate this notion for frontend developers using machine learning libraries, the talk will also share some startups and companies using machine learning libraries in the frontend and browser side for their products. This talk is ideal for all frontend developers who wish to bring their next startup idea to life, or for those looking to use AI to create a competitive differentiator.

It's a great way to improve the quality of work, to train people, and to build in redundancy. So why not use what we know about this way of working throughout an organisation?\r\n\r\nWe are one of the fastest growing digital agencies in Australia. With that growth has come an opportunity to tailor the way our teams operate to the stage our customers' businesses are in. We have become specialists in lean product thinking for startups, continual validation and iteration with scale-ups, entrenching world-class digital practices in mature digital first companies, and experts in scalability, infrastructure, and standards compliance for our enterprise customers.\r\n\r\nWith this organisational structure comes a need to lead large crews of specialists - and that leadership needs to be both inward and outward facing. We need our leaders to be geographically close to our customers so they can absorb the culture of an organisation and move quickly to meet customer expectations. Our leaders need to be excellent coaches of skills relevant to the business they work for and which will help them grow appropriately. Our leaders need to be close to the staff they work with to give support, celebrate victories and foster long-lived relationships.\r\n\r\nThe challenge we found is that one person rarely excels in all these areas, and with that revelation came the idea to apply the pairing principle to all our leadership roles. By pairing up our leaders, they can work to their strengths whilst developing their 'backhand' skills with a complimentary partner. It builds in redundancy, allows emerging leaders to be closely mentored as they develop their skills, and helps form meaningful relationships even at the executive level.\r\n\r\nPeople often say ‘It's lonely at the top.’  - but it doesn't have to be.","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

Automated tests provide us with great benefits that most of us know. \r\n\r\nAutomated tests have traditionally been used for other purposes as well. For example, they have been widely used tests for documentation and onboarding. In other cases, they have also been used to create OpenAPI specification docs using tools like rswag, etc. \r\n\r\nRecently, over the past few months, we've been working on a different use case that takes advantage of existing automated tests - creating trial accounts and seeding them with curated sales narratives that helped increase sales. \r\n\r\nFor an extended period, we have had different takes on setting up trial accounts for prospects who wanted to try out our platform. But for different reasons, they have failed to eventuate. \r\n\r\nThat changed when we had a light bulb moment. We took a different path to enabling trial accounts. We used existing API tests and created a step functions-based workflow that combined different tests, orchestrated them into creating trial accounts and seeding them with curated data through different tests. \r\n\r\nWe analysed five different methods, and we chose two of them to implement our solution. \r\n\r\nThis talk is about the whole journey from a product and a technical perspective.

More specifically, focusing on things we take for granted and the little things we could do to help us stand apart from other candidates.\r\n\r\nI'm incredibly passionate about this topic because my most recent job hunt helped me realize how challenging this whole process can be, even more so because there are so many aspects to it that we should discuss more. The focus is always on perfecting your knowledge of data structures and algorithms and rarely on the little things that help you stand out as a candidate. After all, there can be multiple people who're going to solve a given problem, but only a couple who'll have offers extended to them. So what are these candidates doing differently? How is their approach to this process unique compared to all others? That is what I want to explore with this workshop.\r\n\r\nDetailed description:\r\nThis will be a story-telling style presentation specifically meant for interns, new graduates, and career changers looking for opportunities within the tech industry. For each of the three major sections listed below, I plan on sharing 1-2 personal experiences, sample emails, and messages and concluding each category by sharing my recommendations on best approaching the challenges stated. Sharing personal experiences makes the content more relatable for attendees and also keeps them engaged for a more extended period. I have done a similar style of presentation at other speaking engagements.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to help attendees draw meaningful connections, I've structured the session to introduce each section in chronological order, i.e., in the same order you would experience it when you start your job hunt.\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n- Overview of the motivation behind this talk.\r\n- About me: a quick overview of my educational and professional background.\r\n- Agenda of the session.\r\n\r\nNow, I'll move to the three broad categories detailed below and bullet points detailing what I plan to cover for each:\r\n\r\n1. Pre-Interview\r\n- The art of networking, specifically post-pandemic since COVID has changed the recruiting landscape significantly.\r\n- Recommendations include the importance of your elevator pitch, templates on best reaching out to recruiters virtually, harnessing the power of referrals, and expanding your network through coffee chats.\r\n- How many jobs should you apply to, and how (using platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn and the importance of staying consistent with applying to jobs instead of sporadically).\r\n\r\n2. Interview\r\n- In-depth explanation of how technical interviews are conducted, i.e., multiple rounds, broken down into behavioral, technical, and system design questions.\r\n- A deep dive into the types of questions we can see in each round and how to best answer them.\r\n- Recommendations on what the optimal strategy could look like, including the importance of communication, writing test cases, asking questions, and clarifying assumptions, among others.\r\n\r\n3. Post Interview\r\n- Post-interview etiquette, i.e., reaching out to your recruiter about the expected timeline, what to do in case of rejection or an offer, and an overview of what happens behind the scenes once you're finished with your interviews.\r\n- The art of negotiation! This is something I'm incredibly passionate about and is so often swept under the rug! Strategies to best negotiate your offer and an explanation of compensation packages in the tech industry (equity, base salary, signing, and annual bonus).\r\n\r\n- Conclusion\r\n\r\n- Q&A\r\n\r\nPrerequisite knowledge: Just a healthy curiosity for how to succeed in technical interviews!\r\n\r\nLearning outcomes:\r\n1. Outline what the technical interview process looks like end to end, specifically for attendees new to the process.\r\n2. Distinguish the factors that result in a 'hire' vs. 'no hire' decision, especially for attendees who feel frustrated with their lack of success in technical interviews despite seemingly doing everything correctly.\r\n3. Exemplify the importance of negotiating your salary","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"iX1WEyB4SrgFIlG//m46oEmujz/mshwkzw0qRY6+HrtxZepA/Ha9FrOuOCnr6PFxbfrqZCyDIpZhkl0BVFjaj9XNGOQCu4FdmUxsHjy9ZshRlSSAvWlYPNKghOw4FIfPaD6bMd85rUodUnDQYLVq6gLDIbwt6UT9nENaJveC9HuEm3d0f8jc0zaW606d7YfD","Title":"Automating the real-user scenarios across multi-apps, and multi-devices","Abstract":"Simulating real-user scenarios as part of your automation is a solved problem. You need to understand the domain, the product, the user, and then define and implement your scenario.\r\n\r\nBut there are some types of scenarios that are complex to implement. These are the real-world scenarios having multiple personas (users) interacting with each other to use some business functionalities. These personas may be on the same platform or different (web / mobile-web / native apps / desktop applications).\r\n\r\nExample scenarios:\r\n- How do you check if more than 1 person is able to join a zoom / teams meeting? And that they can interact with each other?\r\n- How do you check if the end-2-end scenario that involves multiple users, across multiple apps works as expected?\r\n    Given user places order on Amazon (app / browser)\r\n    When delivery agent delivers the order (using Delivery app)\r\n    Then user can see the order status as \"Delivered\"\r\n\r\nEven though we will automate and test each application in such interactions independently, or test each persona scenarios independently, we need a way to build confidence that these multiple personas and applications can work together. These scenarios are critical to automate!\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will demonstrate teswiz, an open-source framework can easily automate these multi-user, multi-app, multi-device scenarios. I will also mention how to run these tests on local and in CI pipelines.\r\n\r\nExample: Multi-user, Multi-device test scenario\r\n  @multiuser-android-web @videoRequest\r\n  Scenario: Host (on Android) requests Guest (on Web) to start video\r\n    Given \"Host\" signs up (using API), logs-in and starts an instant meeting on \"android\"\r\n    And \"Guest\" joins the meeting from \"web\"\r\n    When \"Host\" asks \"Guest\" to turn on the \"video\"\r\n    Then \"Guest\" should be able to select \"later\" from video request\r\n    And \"Host\" should receive a toast saying, \"Guest\" will switch on the \"video\" later\r\n    When \"Host\" asks \"Guest\" to turn on \"video\"\r\n    Then \"Guest\" should be able to select \"allow\" from video request\r\n\r\nExample: Multi-user, Multi-app, Multi-device test scenario\r\n  @multiuser-android\r\n  Scenario: Verify my order status when delivery-agent delivers the app successfully\r\n    Given \"I\" order a \"One Plus 9\" phone from \"amazon\" using the \"android app\"\r\n    When \"delivery-agent\" delivers the app using the \"delivery-agent\" \"android app\"\r\n    Then \"I\" can see the item delivered in Order Status\r\n\r\nTeswiz enables, and guides you to implement your automated tests while adhering to the principles of test automation, like - independent tests that run in parallel, against multiple environments using environment-specific-test-data and generate rich and contextual reports (and test execution trends) in reportportal. \r\n\r\nTest coverage is increased by using Applitools Visual AI, along with Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud. \r\n\r\nIn addition, teswiz takes away the pain of managing your browsers, and android / ios / windows devices for automation. The automated tests can run on local browsers / devices, or against any cloud provider, such as HeadSpin, BrowserStack, SauceLabs, pCloudy.\r\n\r\nThe following features makes teswiz unique:\r\n\r\nThe ability to do:\r\n- Multi-user scenario automation between all platforms (android, iOS, Web, Windows desktop applications)\r\n- Managing browsers / devices and parallel execution automatically\r\n- Completely configurable options - means no code change required to run different combinations of tests, on demand\r\n- Integration with Applitools Visual AI and Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud\r\n- Rich contextual reports (including screenshots, browser / device logs) and trend analysis via ReportPortal.io","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

However, modern browsers generally comply with W3C specifications, meaning that if a functionality works in one browser, it will likely work in others as well. The main differences lie in rendering, which still needs to be validated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the traditional cross-browser testing strategy may need reconsidering and updating. It is inefficient to run the same tests on all browsers.

The ever evolving technological solutions and constantly developing business needs are taking software quality assurance to the next level where some burning questions are yet to be answered:\r\n\r\nWhy is software testing still vital to the success of any IT project?\r\nWhy is it so challenging to perform testing effectively?\r\nHow will AI shape quality assurance?\r\nHow to find the best approach tailored to the individual needs of a company?\r\n\r\nIn the quest of finding answers to these questions, most IT professionals quickly encounter the prospect of Testing as a Service (TaaS) as a viable solution. A true TaaS model not only guarantees scalability of resources but also successfully bridges any knowledge gaps in a project.\r\n\r\nA carefully selected automation strategy combined with the most recent, highly innovative automation testing tools grants a seamless and accelerated testing process. This allows human resources to be utilized for more focused and complex work, so that 'humans can do that computers can’t'.\r\n\r\nThe rapid emergence of sophisticated AI solutions are taking software testing to new dimensions. Leveraging AI in testing enables the combination of existing testing tools, artifacts and processes which will result in better software quality, therefore a better quality of life for all.","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"Ouf6K6+uED6BFwxwgx298ZBrxkoJZB6Ie5mmlSM2pdgoFz6Vjr5bO/8ZMTWlXmdbECvavaSTQog2LC7hOKR4EnJn3luMVoBtlvcFTJJORPzyESHBwWSEpLfspSfPMqjQfO0/57MpH5RvXcKSTLQySBYllSi0sPYI1Ua0FaSIxn8Cpbdfm5fArNu5lMzBu1Tj","Title":"Well Connected - Small Steps You Can Take To Increase Your Impact","Abstract":"Keeping your head down and working hard is not enough anymore.

Waste manifests as business misalignment, slow response to opportunities, poor quality of outputs, and employee disengagement. Waste can be any activity that doesn’t deliver value, but where the cause may be hidden.\r\n\r\nWe’ll review the manufacturing roots of the 7 forms of waste known as Muda in Lean, and how they have been reinterpreted for knowledge work like software engineering. Identifying and managing these wastes is core to modern software delivery and all spheres of business operations. We’ll then consider the data organisation as a factory that produces data, a factory that is constantly reconfigured by engineering as business needs change. This will allow us to identify and characterise the impact of the wastes of data production that emerge in building and running a data organisation and data platform. Initiatives like the DataOps Manifesto and Cookbook also embed this Lean philosophy.\r\n\r\nWith wastes understood, we’ll identify potential interventions to improve alignment, responsiveness, quality and engagement in data engineering. We will also introduce the Improvement Kata approach that provides a framework that any team can use for continuous improvement. You’ll leave with a good understanding how to reduce waste in data production, in order to restore pristine pipelines.","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"omgMrKB327Lw3EKWLSH8ijnXPL12LcMH7cafNMdyl067oxXKRooSfyQOT8QY0avdj1bNWvNHp0SJOoRKE6XovWrp3+ucth2BbQH7uEs43e3YTL1vLp0978hCHINfYnEppDcbcLqC0dj8LmJJZBH1zN9s0x8Wee3xawfuk1ERgvbPm+Qdka4Vt/rYV4Cz5GIW","Title":"From monolith to microservices and beyond","Abstract":"The monolithic architecture is - after being overshadowed by microservices for years - working on a comeback.

Is it possible to fight Ruby? Is it possible to create a hardware-sparing robot running Ruby and integrated it across the web to track her training progress as well as verse her coding pair in a battle of real vs virtual fighting? Come on a journey of ups and downs and the state of MRuby for hardware dev, JRuby running on mobile, and CRuby for the backend.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\nDuring the lockdown, our presenters missed not only in-person pairing but also the side passion of Muay Thai Kickboxing and maintaining and extending their State Title. As pairing went remote so did the idea of training in gyms and sparring partners. This is how I hatched an idea to build a sparring robot to train and fight against. Given my familiarity with Ruby, I thought that was the logical place to start with a sparring robot. This is how a long journey of ups and downs started that overviews the current state of Hardware development and using MRuby, mobile development using JRuby, and tying it all together on the server with CRuby.\r\n\r\nThe talk will demonstrate how to get started with MRuby for hardware and what are the limitations as well as benefits of using Ruby. It will touch on what is involved in using JRuby to power Android mobile devices and it will wrap up with a demonstration of a system composed of MRuby, JRuby, and CRuby.

More specifically, focusing on things we take for granted and the little things we could do to help us stand apart from other candidates.\r\n\r\nI'm incredibly passionate about this topic because my most recent job hunt helped me realize how challenging this whole process can be, even more so because there are so many aspects to it that we should discuss more. The focus is always on perfecting your knowledge of data structures and algorithms and rarely on the little things that help you stand out as a candidate. After all, there can be multiple people who're going to solve a given problem, but only a couple who'll have offers extended to them. So what are these candidates doing differently? How is their approach to this process unique compared to all others? That is what I want to explore with this workshop.\r\n\r\nDetailed description:\r\nThis will be a story-telling style presentation specifically meant for interns, new graduates, and career changers looking for opportunities within the tech industry. For each of the three major sections listed below, I plan on sharing 1-2 personal experiences, sample emails, and messages and concluding each category by sharing my recommendations on best approaching the challenges stated. Sharing personal experiences makes the content more relatable for attendees and also keeps them engaged for a more extended period. I have done a similar style of presentation at other speaking engagements.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to help attendees draw meaningful connections, I've structured the session to introduce each section in chronological order, i.e., in the same order you would experience it when you start your job hunt.\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n- Overview of the motivation behind this talk.\r\n- About me: a quick overview of my educational and professional background.\r\n- Agenda of the session.\r\n\r\nNow, I'll move to the three broad categories detailed below and bullet points detailing what I plan to cover for each:\r\n\r\n1. Pre-Interview\r\n- The art of networking, specifically post-pandemic since COVID has changed the recruiting landscape significantly.\r\n- Recommendations include the importance of your elevator pitch, templates on best reaching out to recruiters virtually, harnessing the power of referrals, and expanding your network through coffee chats.\r\n- How many jobs should you apply to, and how (using platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn and the importance of staying consistent with applying to jobs instead of sporadically).\r\n\r\n2. Interview\r\n- In-depth explanation of how technical interviews are conducted, i.e., multiple rounds, broken down into behavioral, technical, and system design questions.\r\n- A deep dive into the types of questions we can see in each round and how to best answer them.\r\n- Recommendations on what the optimal strategy could look like, including the importance of communication, writing test cases, asking questions, and clarifying assumptions, among others.\r\n\r\n3. Post Interview\r\n- Post-interview etiquette, i.e., reaching out to your recruiter about the expected timeline, what to do in case of rejection or an offer, and an overview of what happens behind the scenes once you're finished with your interviews.\r\n- The art of negotiation! This is something I'm incredibly passionate about and is so often swept under the rug! Strategies to best negotiate your offer and an explanation of compensation packages in the tech industry (equity, base salary, signing, and annual bonus).\r\n\r\n- Conclusion\r\n\r\n- Q&A\r\n\r\nPrerequisite knowledge: Just a healthy curiosity for how to succeed in technical interviews!\r\n\r\nLearning outcomes:\r\n1. Outline what the technical interview process looks like end to end, specifically for attendees new to the process.\r\n2. Distinguish the factors that result in a 'hire' vs. 'no hire' decision, especially for attendees who feel frustrated with their lack of success in technical interviews despite seemingly doing everything correctly.\r\n3. Exemplify the importance of negotiating your salary","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

Automated tests provide us with great benefits that most of us know. \r\n\r\nAutomated tests have traditionally been used for other purposes as well. For example, they have been widely used tests for documentation and onboarding. In other cases, they have also been used to create OpenAPI specification docs using tools like rswag, etc. \r\n\r\nRecently, over the past few months, we've been working on a different use case that takes advantage of existing automated tests - creating trial accounts and seeding them with curated sales narratives that helped increase sales. \r\n\r\nFor an extended period, we have had different takes on setting up trial accounts for prospects who wanted to try out our platform. But for different reasons, they have failed to eventuate. \r\n\r\nThat changed when we had a light bulb moment. We took a different path to enabling trial accounts. We used existing API tests and created a step functions-based workflow that combined different tests, orchestrated them into creating trial accounts and seeding them with curated data through different tests. \r\n\r\nWe analysed five different methods, and we chose two of them to implement our solution. \r\n\r\nThis talk is about the whole journey from a product and a technical perspective. It shows how automated tests can have a wide range of additional benefits, besides providing the biggest of all, testing your system. \r\n\r\nTests are good! ","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

You need to understand the domain, the product, the user, and then define and implement your scenario.\r\n\r\nBut there are some types of scenarios that are complex to implement. These are the real-world scenarios having multiple personas (users) interacting with each other to use some business functionalities. These personas may be on the same platform or different (web / mobile-web / native apps / desktop applications).\r\n\r\nExample scenarios:\r\n- How do you check if more than 1 person is able to join a zoom / teams meeting? And that they can interact with each other?\r\n- How do you check if the end-2-end scenario that involves multiple users, across multiple apps works as expected?\r\n    Given user places order on Amazon (app / browser)\r\n    When delivery agent delivers the order (using Delivery app)\r\n    Then user can see the order status as \"Delivered\"\r\n\r\nEven though we will automate and test each application in such interactions independently, or test each persona scenarios independently, we need a way to build confidence that these multiple personas and applications can work together. These scenarios are critical to automate!\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will demonstrate teswiz, an open-source framework can easily automate these multi-user, multi-app, multi-device scenarios. I will also mention how to run these tests on local and in CI pipelines.\r\n\r\nExample: Multi-user, Multi-device test scenario\r\n  @multiuser-android-web @videoRequest\r\n  Scenario: Host (on Android) requests Guest (on Web) to start video\r\n    Given \"Host\" signs up (using API), logs-in and starts an instant meeting on \"android\"\r\n    And \"Guest\" joins the meeting from \"web\"\r\n    When \"Host\" asks \"Guest\" to turn on the \"video\"\r\n    Then \"Guest\" should be able to select \"later\" from video request\r\n    And \"Host\" should receive a toast saying, \"Guest\" will switch on the \"video\" later\r\n    When \"Host\" asks \"Guest\" to turn on \"video\"\r\n    Then \"Guest\" should be able to select \"allow\" from video request\r\n\r\nExample: Multi-user, Multi-app, Multi-device test scenario\r\n  @multiuser-android\r\n  Scenario: Verify my order status when delivery-agent delivers the app successfully\r\n    Given \"I\" order a \"One Plus 9\" phone from \"amazon\" using the \"android app\"\r\n    When \"delivery-agent\" delivers the app using the \"delivery-agent\" \"android app\"\r\n    Then \"I\" can see the item delivered in Order Status\r\n\r\nTeswiz enables, and guides you to implement your automated tests while adhering to the principles of test automation, like - independent tests that run in parallel, against multiple environments using environment-specific-test-data and generate rich and contextual reports (and test execution trends) in reportportal. \r\n\r\nTest coverage is increased by using Applitools Visual AI, along with Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud. \r\n\r\nIn addition, teswiz takes away the pain of managing your browsers, and android / ios / windows devices for automation. The automated tests can run on local browsers / devices, or against any cloud provider, such as HeadSpin, BrowserStack, SauceLabs, pCloudy.\r\n\r\nThe following features makes teswiz unique:\r\n\r\nThe ability to do:\r\n- Multi-user scenario automation between all platforms (android, iOS, Web, Windows desktop applications)\r\n- Managing browsers / devices and parallel execution automatically\r\n- Completely configurable options - means no code change required to run different combinations of tests, on demand\r\n- Integration with Applitools Visual AI and Applitools Ultrafast Test Cloud\r\n- Rich contextual reports (including screenshots, browser / device logs) and trend analysis via ReportPortal.io","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

Achieving continuous delivery (deploying changes to production daily or on-demand) is proven to accelerate delivery, enhance reliability, and boost customer-team satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHowever, achieving and sustaining continuous delivery takes effort, and the DORA research program highlighted that almost 80% of teams remain stuck on mid-level performance. \r\nMaintaining high delivery while also operating tens of components is complex. \r\n\r\nA significant barrier to improvement is that urgent issues often eclipse continuous improvement in software teams. Having worked with hundreds of individual teams globally, I witnessed a clear hierarchy of needs within an Engineering team. This hierarchy happens daily in teams' decisions on what to work on and explains why we see behaviour like:\r\n- Ignoring failing tests\r\n- Deferring security patching\r\n- Having 'no time' to take on junior Engineers.\r\n\r\nWhen teams embrace this reality, we can model these needs to systematically enable low-level requirements and give them the space to mature higher-order capabilities. \r\n\r\nThis talk is for people who lead, support or want to influence teams towards continuous delivery. We have been modelling a hierarchy of engineering needs for several years and want to share a high-level overview of how we apply it. When are teams ready for test-driven development? What are the actual dependencies for continuous deployment? How do we build resilience in our teams and systems?\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we'll cover:\r\n- Framing Engineering needs in a hierarchy\r\n- Maturity grading current platform & enablement capabilities \r\n- Using surveys and self-assessments to cross-check priorities\r\n\r\nJoin us in unlocking the key to balancing urgent issues with continuous improvement in your engineering teams.","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"XqGEJb7xVJeEVdHLUM45FVAPwbDM0IfdnSJJ//KDfyHjtZQABVrM2v7Ow3z+97wEa5k74eoAPkCZgciVJtbNNfMY5l7o8mHABUizp3SgSQsO6CCiOcmHniMVVHIiFodczGspYhWXkx1CqzrgjTZKYgOq5nsU3H+gLOIsFZHmMiijSko7aYdCfEF1BM2VuGR3","Title":"Automating cloud infrastructure with Ansible","Abstract":"During my discussion, I will delve into the principal workings of Ansible and provide guidance on how to get started configuring your cloud infrastructure.

Regression testing, while a powerful tool, may not always be the most practical solution in such environments. While this form of testing has traditionally been used to identify defects and issues with software, the process can be slow, expensive, and can impede development teams from experimenting with new code on production.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, many organizations have shifted their focus towards developing tools and environments that support testing on production. By leveraging tools like canary releases, shadowing traffic, and beta testing, developers can collect sufficient data points to ensure that a release is stable without the need for regression testing. These tools allow for more streamlined and efficient feedback on code changes, enabling engineers to experiment with new code and quickly identify and address any issues that may arise.","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

Think about some of the most impressive websites you’ve seen, were they static content or did the site interact with you as you navigate around the page?\r\n\r\nWe often don’t put enough emphasis on these finer points, considering them “nice-to-haves” or “gimmicks”, and forgetting the difference they can make to the experience our users can have. These touches don’t have to involve heavy animation libraries either, they can be added with a few lines of CSS and occasionally a small script that runs after the page is loaded.\r\n\r\nOnce all is said and done, we’re generally moving on to testing and launching and we forget to focus on the little touches that make our website special. It might be as simple as adding some hover effects, or using CSS animations to bring life to the page.\r\n\r\nSo let’s spend some time on the finer points. On transitions, and micro-animations; on what should be designed and built to take our websites and make them wow!","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

But the same is not true for mobile apps. Did you want to kick start your journey into mobile test automation ? Or have you found it harder to choose the right one for your team ? Let's get started!\r\n\r\nMobile apps have grown exponentially over the last few years. Usability, convenience and user experience has made mobile apps very popular. While web apps are still popular, the testing methods and test frameworks have become so mature due to the longevity of the technology. The same cannot be said for mobile apps. \r\n\r\nWhile development of mobile apps have become easier and more adaptable over the years, testing and test frameworks have not grown at the same pace. Therefore it has been considerably easier to test and write test frameworks for web apps than for mobile. \r\n\r\nSo how do we solve this problem ? The best way to deal with this, is to try out the different options available in the market. In this talk, I will be showing with real examples, how to write an end to end test for a mobile app using Espresso, XCUI Testing, Detox and Appium. At the same time, I will also explain where these frameworks can add value to the teams, that way you can pick the best one that suits your team and your team’s skill sets. \r\n\r\nLet's get more confident in writing tests for mobile apps!","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]}}

Distributed architectures will be comprised of different services, which will have their own requirements such as different data stores, different consistency levels, unique functionality, and different observability needs. This can lead to architectures using a variety of different services and tools to fulfil these requirements, making the application code complex and difficult to refactor when requirements change later on.\r\n\r\nThe Dapr framework addresses this complexity through its architecture of pluggable components, which simplifies the development of distributed applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll cover the Dapr architecture and how the building blocks that the Dapr runtime provides simplifies the plumbing of distributed applications. I'll then dive into a demo that showcases how you can use the Dapr framework within your .NET applications and how you can host your Dapr applications on platforms such as Kubernetes and Azure Container Apps.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll gain an understanding of what the Dapr framework is and how you can use it to simplify the development of .NET microservicesBuilding resilient and reliable microservices with the Dapr Framework, .NET and Azure\r\n","Format":null,"Level":null,"Tags":[]},"SubmissionB":{"Id":"hYjQJJqv8F8fgnC0JiOutrSumiDmyI5IEuEkQ0HOTO5BBGr+BXGgjrF1tI3sQ+QMdrERWvlY7uDMwFp4TiS3s+X25sp4AtlOxINYdZN1IrQ9iA5MsnShvXVV7vr5QLj/hxFAAW9nb5F2XkOZUzygeEbehPRsk4JZFpWagglbhv3wsxn2vTGMSgvW8RugS3hb","Title":"Making Web more Native","Abstract":"PWA has seen a huge surge in recent years and businesses have been benefiting a lot from them.
