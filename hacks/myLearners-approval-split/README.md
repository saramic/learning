# myLearners approval split

althought he Victorian myLearners app shows you a history of all approved
drives for a candidate for their first 120 hours as an L plater, it does not do
the split between how many of the hours you verified, vs in my case my wife for
our kids. Using burp suite to get a full dump, this is the process of
processing the output to work out how many of the 120 hours I verified.

```sh
./processor.rb
{"Felix":96.1,"Matilda":35.0}
```
