## Coupling

From DDD Europe

* good overview of coupling and it's inherent part of system design
* coupling models and levels of **complexity** from Structured Design,
  **levels**: content, common, external, control, stamp and data complexity
    * _any talk that mentions Edward Yourdon, Structured Design is a winner_
* **connascence layers: static** - name & type, meaning, algorithm, position and
  **dynamic**: execution, timing, value, identity
* to drive out Vlad Khononov model of
    * Strength: intrusive, functional, model, contract
    * Volatility: how often does it change
    * Distance: statement, method, class, namespace, component, (micro)
      service, system
* `Pain = 𝑓(S * V * D)`

[
    Balancing Coupling in Software Design - Vlad Khononov - DDD Europe 2023
](https://youtu.be/KTy4rqgPOjg)

example:

* having duplicate logic to calculate something (functional strength) in the
  same class (class distance) in a CSV importer (low volatility as pretty
  generic and likely not core functionality)
* may not be as coupled as...
* Referencing models (model strength) across packwerk packs (component
  distance) in core business flow (high volatility as core functionality
  and often changing)

interview about a recent book on this topic by that presenter

**Balancing Coupling in Software Design - Vlad Khononov - DDD Europe 2023**
[
    Balancing Coupling in Software Design: Universal Design Principles for
    Architecting Modular Software Systems
](https://youtu.be/_9vi70yFBDg)

Vlad also wrote the classic:
* [Learning Domain-Driven Design: Aligning Software Architecture and Business
  Strategy](
  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57573212-learning-domain-driven-design)

the interview seems more of a puff piece:
* coupling is a way to shoot yourself in programming back in the 60's and 70's
  (Structured Design days) as well as now in Microservices days
* a bit of a discussion of how he distilled these old ideas into the modern
  view of integration strength
* assessing complexity to have more educated estimation
* ideas of local vs global complexity and how important that is in getting
  microservices right

book also covers [Cynefin
framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework)
which is also useful in categorising complexity in things like software
systems:
* **clear** - you know how to do it and you do it
* **complicated** - you may need to reach out to an expert to get it done
* **complex** - unknown unknowns, need to run experiments to work out cause and
  effect, how users interact with a system or when the contract between two
  systems is not clear
* **chaotic** - even running experiments does not yield the same result each
  time
